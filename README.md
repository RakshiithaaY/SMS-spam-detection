SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning

Overview

This project implements an SMS spam detection system using machine learning models. The goal is to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam) based on their content. The system leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques for feature extraction and applies machine learning algorithms for classification.

Features:

Preprocessing of SMS text (e.g., removing punctuation, stopwords, and tokenization).
Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF and Count Vectorization.
Implementation of various ML models such as:
Evaluation of model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Dataset:

The project uses a publicly available SMS Spam Collection dataset containing labeled SMS messages. Each message is labeled as spam or ham.
